# i_can_count

As a user,
- I want to be able to apply arithmetic to play the game (ie, be able to mark out X and O on a 9-grid box).
- I would like feedback on my choices, ie, when I win and make a mistake.
- I want to be able to track my progress in the game (ie, amount of time left, which level)

Overall look and feel:
- game is targeted for children below 5 yo, so bright colours and images would be preferred
- but considering that this is a project, i will prioritise the business logic.
- will go for minimalist design, get the game working

Pseudocode
- outlines the app's logic using plain language. It provides a road map to writing the code itself. For example, pseudocoding the logic for when a player makes a move, checking if the game has been won, etc., will prove to be helpful when
writing the actual code.
