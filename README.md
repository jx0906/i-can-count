# i_can_count

As a user,
- I want to be able to apply arithmetic to play the game (ie, be able to mark out X and O on a 9-grid box).
- I would like feedback on my choices, ie, when I win and make a mistake.
- I want to be able to track my progress in the game (ie, amount of time left, which level)

Overall look and feel:
- game is targeted for children below 5 yo, so bright colours and images would be preferred
- but considering that this is a project, i will prioritise the business logic.
- will go for minimalist design, get the game working

Pseudocode
- outlines the app's logic using plain language. It provides a road map to writing the code itself. For example, pseudocoding the logic for when a player makes a move, checking if the game has been won, etc., will prove to be helpful when
writing the actual code.

A README.md file with these sections:

☐ <Your game's title>: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

☐ Screenshot(s): Images of your actual game.

☐ Technologies Used: List of the technologies used, e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

☐ Getting Started: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

☐ Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

Note: Don't underestimate the value of a well crafted README.md. The README.md introduces your project to prospective employers and forms their first impression of your work!
